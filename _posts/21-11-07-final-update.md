# Good Bye Kakara
Two years ago me(KingTux) and Ryandw11 started Kakara out of pure interest. We said lets make a Minecraft alternative. We should make our own game and learn game development. So that is what we did.  Both of us learned a lot of new skills. However, due to time constraints and new interests we have decided to shut Kakara down. Ryandw11 plans to keep Kakara Engine around. The rest of the projects will be archived. 

## Goodbye? 
Me and Ryandw11 plan to continue to work on projects together. So I recommend following us. Give us both a follow on our Github.  We will be creating new stuff in the future.

## Website
The [Getting Started](https://kakara.org/getting-started/) page has been updated with information about installing and using Kakara via the Kakara Launcher. The steps are simple and should be easy to follow. If you need any help installing Kakara you can ask for help through our [discord](https://discord.gg/X6Ew5nkNA6). The footer icons of the website have also been updated.

## General Project Updates
Development on Kakara as a whole has been slow for the past few months but is currently speeding up.

### Kakara
Kakara has received several stability updates to make the game more stable and bug free. The source code is also receiving a clean up to allow for better development times. More features will be added to the game soon.

### Engine
Since the past update Engine Prerelease 5 has been released. The Engine has no major update plans at this time and is only receiving minor feature and stability updates. While not relating to the Kakara project, the engine has also received a [2D addon](https://github.com/ryandw11/KakaraEngine2D) which allows 2D games to be made with the Kakara Engine.

### Launcher
The launcher now installs the needed components for the game to work, so you no longer need to install Java, the engine, and the client on your own as the launcher will do it for you. The launcher will also setup all of the config files need automatically. Currently the launcher is still only available through the command line but will be updated to a GUI in the future.

## Kakara
The Menus inside are being worked on and should be out within the coming weeks.

A new skybox was added, and we will be trying to add a sun and moon cycle soon.
We are also going to try to get some more core game mechanics done in the coming weeks. 

## Engine
Engine Pre-5 is under heavy work including rewriting the game item system and adding controller support.

Pre-5 will also be documented [here](https://docs.kakara.org/engine/) Thank you Gitbook

## Core
Core is starting to have some documentation [here](https://docs.kakara.org/core/) Thank you Gitbook

## Launcher
KingTux has put work into the launcher trying to get it to a level where regular people can start the game. Hopefully in the coming weeks the launcher will be at a usable state. 
GUI Support is still a while off due to the time it will take.
